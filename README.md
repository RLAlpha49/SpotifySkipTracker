## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Spotify Developer Account:** Required to obtain API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) for accessing Spotify's API.
- **Python 3.10 or higher:** Ensure you have the appropriate version of Python installed.

### Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Spotify Skip Tracker on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RLAlpha49/SpotifySkipTracker.git
   cd SpotifySkipTracker
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configuration File**

   The application uses a `config.json` file to store configuration settings. If it does not exist, the application will create one automatically with required keys initialized to empty strings.

   **Filling Configuration Variables:**

   - Run the application.
   - Click on the "Login with Spotify" button.
   - If any required configuration variables (`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`) are missing, a popup will appear prompting you to enter them.
   - Fill in the required information and click "Save".
   - Click the "Login with Spotify" button again to proceed with authentication.

## Usage
