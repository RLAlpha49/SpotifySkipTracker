# Playback Monitoring and Skip Detection

**As a** user
**I want** the application to automatically monitor my Spotify playback and detect when I skip tracks
**so that** I can get insights into my listening habits without manual intervention

## Status

üîÑ In Progress

## Context

The core functionality of the application is detecting and analyzing skipped tracks. This story implements the playback monitoring service that will run in the background, detect track changes, and identify skips based on configured thresholds.

## Estimation

Story Points: 5

## Tasks

1. - [x] Implement Playback Polling Service

   1. - [x] Create polling mechanism with configurable intervals
   2. - [x] Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies
   3. - [x] Add error handling for API connectivity issues
   4. - [x] Create playback state management

2. - [x] Create Track Change Detection

   1. - [x] Implement track change algorithm
   2. - [x] Design position-based skip detection
   3. - [x] Handle edge cases (app switching, connection loss)
   4. - [x] Add detection for manual vs. automatic track changes

3. - [ ] Implement Skip Data Collection

   1. - [ ] Create data structure for skip events
   2. - [ ] Implement configurable thresholds for skip detection
   3. - [ ] Add metadata collection for skipped tracks
   4. - [ ] Build storage mechanism for skip history

4. - [ ] Develop Monitoring Controls

   1. - [ ] Create start/stop monitoring functionality
   2. - [ ] Implement status indicators
   3. - [ ] Add user notification system
   4. - [ ] Create battery-saving options

5. - [ ] Test Monitoring Systems
   1. - [ ] Test different playback scenarios
   2. - [ ] Validate skip detection accuracy
   3. - [ ] Measure performance impact
   4. - [ ] Verify data collection integrity

## Constraints

- Polling rate must not exceed Spotify API rate limits
- Skip detection must be accurate and respect user-defined thresholds
- Monitoring must have minimal impact on system resources
- Must handle Spotify API connectivity issues gracefully
- Should preserve battery life on laptop devices

## Data Models / Schema

```typescript
interface PlaybackInfo {
  trackId: string; // Spotify track ID
  trackName: string; // Track name
  artistName: string; // Artist name
  albumName: string; // Album name
  albumArt: string; // Album artwork URL
  isPlaying: boolean; // Whether the track is currently playing
  progressMs: number; // Current playback position in milliseconds
  durationMs: number; // Total track duration in milliseconds
  timestamp: number; // When this data was captured
}

interface SkippedTrack {
  id: string; // Track ID
  name: string; // Track name
  artist: string; // Artist name
  album: string; // Album name
  skippedAt: number; // Timestamp when skipped
  playDuration: number; // How long it played before skip (ms)
  trackDuration: number; // Total track duration (ms)
  playPercentage: number; // Percentage of track played
  isRemoved: boolean; // Whether removed from library
}

interface MonitoringState {
  isActive: boolean; // Whether monitoring is running
  startTime: number | null; // When monitoring started
  currentTrack: PlaybackInfo | null;
  lastPolled: number; // Last polling timestamp
  consecutiveErrors: number; // For backoff strategy
}
```

## Structure

The playback monitoring implementation follows this structure:

## Dev Notes

This story implements the core functionality for Spotify playback monitoring and skip detection. Key considerations:

1. **Efficient Polling**: Find the right balance between real-time detection and API rate limits
2. **Accurate Skip Detection**: Consider different scenarios (manual skips, end of track, app switching)
3. **Battery & Resource Optimization**: Use variable polling rates and backoff strategies
4. **Error Resilience**: Handle API failures, network issues, and token expiration gracefully
5. **User Control**: Provide clear status indicators and simple monitoring controls

The monitoring service will run in the main Electron process but provide status updates to the UI through IPC channels. It will maintain playback state and handle the detection logic independent of the renderer process.

## Chat Command Log
