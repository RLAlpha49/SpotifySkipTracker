/**
 * API Retry Utility Module
 *
 * This module provides robust functionality for retrying failed API requests with
 * configurable strategies to improve application reliability in unreliable network
 * conditions or when dealing with service instabilities.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Configurable maximum retry attempts with sensible defaults
 * - Exponential backoff algorithm for progressively increasing wait time
 * - Random jitter to prevent thundering herd problems during service recovery
 * - Comprehensive error logging with attempt tracking and history
 * - Configurable initial delay to customize retry timing
 * - Automatic failure propagation after maximum attempts
 * - Intelligent delay capping to prevent excessive waits
 *
 * The retry system is particularly valuable for Spotify API interactions where
 * temporary rate limiting, network instabilities, or service hiccups can occur.
 * The exponential backoff approach ensures the application doesn't flood the API
 * with retry attempts during outages while still providing resilience.

/**
 * Retries an API call with exponential backoff and jitter
 *
 * Executes an API call and automatically retries it with increasing delay
 * on failure, using a combination of exponential backoff and random jitter
 * to avoid overwhelming the API during recovery periods.
 *
 * The backoff algorithm works as follows:
 * 1. Initial delay starts at initialDelayMs
 * 2. After each failure, delay increases by ~1.5x (with small random variation)
 * 3. Maximum delay is capped at 10 seconds regardless of retry count
 * 4. Random jitter of Â±10% is applied to prevent synchronized retries
 *
 * @param apiCallFn - Function that makes the API request to retry
 * @param maxRetries - Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
 * @param initialDelayMs - Initial delay between retries in milliseconds (default: 1000)
 * @returns Promise resolving to the API call result
 * @throws Error when all retry attempts are exhausted
 *
 * @example
 * // Retry a Spotify API call up to 5 times
 * const playbackState = await retryApiCall(
 *   () => spotifyApi.getMyCurrentPlaybackState(),
 *   5,
 *   500
 * );
